# WordScramble
The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on

The game checks if the word is a valid word using UITextChecker, if  the word is the same of the given word, if the word is more than 3 letter and so on.

When you insert a correct word you get some points based on  how many caracter your word is long.

Resetting the game will reset your score and generate a new word

Used: List, Section, UiTextChecker, Alert, safeAreaInset, withAnimation, some logic for text check
